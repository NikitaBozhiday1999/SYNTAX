    <h3> Subjects of study</h3>
    <p> 
        At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a 
        pretty open-minded research facility &mdash; 
        as long as the Subjects fall somewhere in the 
        realm of science and technology. You seem like 
        an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and
        just the kind of person we'd like to have 
        on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you 
        submitted we were most intrigued by are as 
        follows, in order of priority:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> 
            Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the 
            health benefits of Resveratol 
            (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.) 
        </li>
        <li> 
            Measuring the effect on perfomance of funk
            bassplayers at tempratures exceeding 
            30&ordm;C (86&ordm;F), when the audience
            size explonentially increases (effect of
            3x10<sup>3</sup>&gt;3x10<sup>4</sup>.)
        </li>
        <li> 
            HTML and CCS constructs for representing
            musical scores.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        So please can you provide more information 
        on each of these subjects, including how long
        you'd expect the research to take, required 
        staff and other resources, and anything else 
        you think we'd need to know?
        <br/>
        Thanks.
    </p>
